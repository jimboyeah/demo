The install script in this folder, "install.sh" is
needed only by those who wish to compile and run the
Petzold example programs on the Wine emulator.  The Wine
project is an implementation of the WIN32 API on top of
X and UNIX.  Hence Wine is a compatibility layer that
allows Windows software to run on Intel based Unixes
such as Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.

This special install script is needed because file names 
on the UNIX operating system are case sensitive whereas 
Windows ignores the case of file names.  Consequently 
Mr. Petzold, who developed this code on Windows, may never
have been aware of some inconsistencies in the names of 
his files.  For example, under Windows it is acceptable 
for a .C source file to include a .H header file named 
"Resource.h" via a preprocessor statement such as:

#include "resource.h"

However this same statement fails to find the Resource.h
file when this code is compiled on a UNIX operating
system.  Therefore Dimitrie O. Paun has developed the
"install.sh" script to patch over these differences, 
without requiring source level changes in the original 
Petzold code.  This is accomplished via an automated 
process consisting of file renaming and the creation of 
symbolic links.  All you need to do is to invoke the
"install.sh" script from the directory where you installed
the Petzold project folders (i.e., the directory holding 
directories named Chap01, Chap02, etc.), like this:

bash Wine/install.sh

Once the script runs, you can simply invoke make to
build all 145 of the example programs:

make

Incidentally, the PetzoldConvert.exe program will not
run under Wine (but that's okay since the "install.sh"
script serves as its replacement).


NOTE: Currently, 3 of the example programs do not compile
under Wine:
  - Chap21/EdrTest
  - Chap21/ShowBit
  - Chap21/StrProg

The example programs in Chap21 are using DLLs, and DLLs
are not currently supported by winegcc (The Wine team
hopes to have this capability soon).
