Porting GNU Chess 4.0 to Windows

Most of the original code has been changed very little, except main.c, the
screen display code and the InputCommand function. The main function is now
WinMain. WinMain is a bit unorthodox in that it contains no message loop.
InputCommand, search, EditBoard and Replay contain message loops. This avoids
a lot of fiddling around with the code because the original program flow is
unchanged. WinMain contains the same loop (with some extra code) as found in
the original main function, which alternately calls InputCommand and
SelectMove. In InputCommand, EditBoard and Replay, the message loop continues
until WndProc places a value in command. The search function checks for
messages periodically.

The only new source files are dialogs.c, gnuchess.rc, the icon (from Chess
3.21) and the bitmaps. There are six bitmap files for each piece: a mask and
a detail bitmap in three sizes, 40x40, 60x60 and 80x80. These are derived
from the bitmaps used for winboard. I thought the pawns were a little
imposing so I chopped the bottom off. The width of the Queen has been reduced
so it doesn't hang over the edge of square at the back of the board.

Enjoy!
